# Welcome to my site

I'm interested in mathematics and programming. In particular numerical mathematics, computer vision, robotics, raspberry pi and machine learning. 

I'm studing mathematics at the OTH Regensburg. I focused on numerical mathematics and robotics in my curriculum. At the moment I'm writing my masters thesis. It's about visual servoing, that means how to control a robot with the help of a camera. 

Besides that, I have almost 2 years of professional working experience. I did an internship and was a working student for a company in the automation industry. 

I will move to Berlin in the next months, so I'm currently looking for a job there. 


On this page I'd like present some of my work that I do in my spare time for fun. 

[Here you can see my self driving car powered by a raspberry pi](https://felix-ha.github.io/2019/01/03/gopigo) 

[Here is the cat detector.](https://felix-ha.github.io/2018/11/29/overview_cat_detector) Unfortunately this project is not really finished, but I plan to continue it as soon as I finished my thesis and moved to my new flat.
