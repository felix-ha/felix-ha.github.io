# Welcome to my site

I'm interested in mathematics and programming. In particular numerical mathematics, computer vision, robotics, raspberry pi and machine learning. 

I'm studing mathematics at the OTH Regensburg. I focused on numercial mathematics and robotics in my curriculum. At the moment I'm writing my masters thesis. It's about visual servoing, that means how to controll a robot with the help of a camera. 

Besides that, I have almost 2 years of professional working experience. I did an intership and was a working student for a company in the automation industry. 

On this page I'd like present some of my work.
