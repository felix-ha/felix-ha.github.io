### Self Driving GoPiGo


First of all to get your attention right away:
[here is the video of the car driving.](https://youtu.be/DT_9L6zDL5M)
Now you want to know how it works, don't you? Don't worry I am going to explain now. 

The heart of the algorithm is a convolutional neural network that is trained to deceide wheter a piece of the floor is save for driving or border. For that I collected images and created a dataset. After this a trained the network with tensorflow. 

The part of the algorithm that deceids in which way the car should drive works the following way. Let $$T$$ be a $$ 4 \times 3$$ Matrix and a $$v$$ be a $$4 \times $$. The names indicate the meaning, $$T$$ stand for turn and $$v$$ stands for velocity.  

```python
def driving_algorithm():
    if (steps_to_go == 4):
        distance_to_move = 700
    else:
        distance_to_move = 350

    farest_line = self.car.prediction_array[0, :]

    if (np.sum(self.car.prediction_array) <= 2):
        self.app.autopilot_successfully = True

        self.app.drive_backward(1000)
        time.sleep(1.5)

        random_distance = random.random() * 750 + 500

        if (random.random() > 0.5):
            self.app.drive_right(random_distance)
        else:
            self.app.drive_left(random_distance)
```
