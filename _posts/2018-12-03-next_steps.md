# Next steps

I will implement and test the following techniques to improve the accuracy of the validation set:

* Regularization: Dropout and batch normalization
* Different optimizer 
* Dataset augmentation
* Data preprocessing
* Architecture of the net 


I will combine each of the best working methods and hopefully, the accuracy is close to 1 and a live test will give a satisfying result. 

As I mentioned, I'm currently not working on this.
