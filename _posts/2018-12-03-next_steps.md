# Next steps

I will implement and test the following techniques to improve the accuracy of the validation set:

* [Regularization: Dropout and batch normalization](https://felix-ha.github.io/2018/12/04/droput)
* Different optimizer 
* Dataset Augmention
* Data Preprocessing
* Architechture of the net 


I will comibine each of the best working method and hopefully the accuracy is close to 1 and a live test will give a satisfying result.
