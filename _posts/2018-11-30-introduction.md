# Introduction for the Cat Detector

I am looking forward to building a detector for my two cats. I will use a convolutional neural network for this task. The detector should spot if the cats are eating or not. 

Heres an image of the naps.

And here's an image of the cats while eating.

The neural network is, therefore, a binary classificator and returns a probability of how likely there is a cat on the image. 

I use a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B with the Raspberry Pi camera. The programming language of choice is python. I will train the convolutional neural network with tensorflow to classify the images of the cups. To do basic image processing tasks, I will use OpenCV.

I'm going to do everything from scratch, i. e. I will collect and label the whole data on my own. I also will use no pre-trained neural network.  

I have no idea whether this is going to be successful or not. With this series of posts, I will share the process and results of the development. 

So let's get started! In the next post, I present you the results of the first trained neural network.
